# strap.py

---

## Usage

Clone this repo and put the `strap/` directory somewhere convenient (for this readme, we will assume the user's home directory).

`python ~/strap <uri-or-path-to-repo> [path-to-output-dir]`

It's also immensely helpful to alias `python ~/strap` to something like `strap`.

### strap.json

## Why?

I found myself writing the same old code for every Python project to automate its installation. Conventional programmer's logic states that if you do it more than once, it should become a tool.
